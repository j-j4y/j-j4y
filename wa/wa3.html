    <p>
        The series follows the adventures of a group of girls known as the Winx, students at the Alfea College for Fairies, who turn into fairies to fight villains.
        The team is made up of Bloom, the fairy of the Dragon Flame; Stella, the fairy of the Shining Sun; Flora, the fairy of nature; Tecna, the fairy of technology; Musa, the fairy of music; and Aisha, the fairy of waves.

        The main male characters are called the Specialists, a group of students at the Red Fountain school who are also the Winx fairies' boyfriends.
        They include Bloom's boyfriend Sky; Stella's boyfriend Brandon; Flora's boyfriend Helia; Tecna's boyfriend Timmy; and Musa's boyfriend Riven.
        Unlike their female counterparts, the Specialists do not have magical powers and instead, train how to fight using laser weapons.<br>

        The Winx and Specialists' most common adversaries are a trio of witches named the Trix: Icy, Darcy, and Stormy, all former students of the Cloud Tower school.<br>
        Winx Club is set in a vast universe with several dimensions.
        Most episodes take place in the Magic Dimension, which is closed off to ordinary people and inhabited by creatures from European mythology like fairies, witches, and monsters.
